# Whodunit
An Umbraco plugin which adds a changelog dashboard.

Here is the first thing you see when you open the "History Report" tab:

![Whodunit Tab](assets/images/report.png?raw=true "Whodunit Tab")

Once you click "Generate Report", you will see a "Download Report" link:

![Whodunit Download](assets/images/download.png?raw=true "Whodunit Download")

Once you click the download link, you can open the CSV file, which will look something like this:

![Whodunit CSV](assets/images/csv.png?raw=true "Whodunit CSV")

Keep in mind there may be no entries to being with. Whodunit only tracks changes once it's been installed.
